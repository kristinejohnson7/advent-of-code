## Automation Scripts

`npm run generate-solution-files yy`

- This will generate solution files for the next day of the specified year
- If no year is specified the current year is used as the default
- The first time this is run for a given year, a `solutions-yyyy` directory will be created along with the a directory for the first days solution files.
- `next day` is determined by looking at the days that have already been generated by the given year
- Inside the directory generated for the day will be a data.txt file containing your personalized input data (pulled using your session) and a solution.ts file containing a function stub that pulls in the data from the data.txt file.
- This can be used to generate solution file from archived years all the way back to 2015.

`npm run exec d yy`

- This will execute the first exported function from the specified solution file.
- The yy (year) is an optional parameter. If not provided it will default to 22 and look for the corresponding day.
- The d (d) parameter is required.
- The exec script will run the ts file using ts-node. It also logs performance detials and the value returned by the function.
